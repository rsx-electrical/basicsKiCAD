# Introduction to KiCad
## Onboarding project

Welcome all. I'm going to make a couple of assumption which is you have no idea how to use KiCad or maybe you don't even know what KiCad is, but trust you are in good hands.

Let's start with the basics...

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to proceed with this tutorial you must 
> 1. Download KiCad onto your local computer (download the most updated please)
> 2. Clone this repository onto your local computer: [rsx_standard_library](https://github.com/rsx-electrical/rsx_standard_library)


### What is KiCad?
It is a software for developing printed circuit boards (PCBs). If those words went over your head let's start with an analogy--designing a PCB is analogous to playing with legos. 

There are three important sections in PCB that will be highlighted through builidng a lego house
1. Schematic: This is where you choose your components: resistor, LEDs, etc. So this is where you choose the legos to design your lego house. 
2. PCB Layout: This is where you structure how your components will be wired together. So this is where you design how the legos will eventually fit together. 
3. Assembly. This is where you build you PCB by soldering. So this is where you finally get to stack the legos together to build a house. 

Of couse in this tutorial you won't actually get to this step 3, as KiCad only allows for steps 1 and 2. 

### A Simple Design
#### Introduction to the Desgin
So now let's get onto using KiCad. Today you are tasked with creating a PCB that allows for an LED to turn on. Fun right!

*Figure 1: Final 3D model of the PCB*

If we look at the photo, you'll see the following labels D1, R1, and J1--these are footprint references. 
- D1: LED
- R1: Resistor
- J1: Screw terminal. (There is also a 1 next to the screw terminal. This is a footrprint text used for distinguishing the two terminals) 

#### Steps to this Simple Design
1. Make a new project: 
    - File -> New Project 
    - Give it a name: *Onboarding*
    - Put it in a folder (for reference I put it in this folder: Documents/RSX/Onboarding)

    *Figure 2: The KiCad hompage*
    - You should see something that looks this
2. Click on the **Schematic Editor** in Figure 2
    - We are getting to the section where we can choose the legos to build our house. How exciting!!!
