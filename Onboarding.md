# Introduction to KiCad
## Onbarding project

Welcome all. I'm going to make a couple of assumption which is you have no idea how to use KiCad or maybe you don't even know what KiCad is, but trust you are in good hands.

Let's start with the basics...

### What is KiCad?
It is a software for developing printed circuit boards (PCBs). If those words went over your head let's start with an analogy--designing a PCB is analogous to playing with legos. 

There are three important sections in PCB that will be highlighted through builidng a lego house
1. Schematic: This is where you choose your components: resistor, LEDs, etc. So this is where you choose the legos to design your lego house. 
2. PCB Layout: This is where you structure how your components will be wired together. So this is where you design how the legos will eventually fit together. 
3. Assembly. This is where you build you PCB by soldering. So this is where you finally get to stack the legos together to build a house. 

Of couse in this tutorial you won't actually get to this step 3, as KiCad only allows for steps 1 and 2. 

### A Simple Design
So now let's get onto using KiCad. Today you are tasked with creating a PCB that allows for an LED to turn on.
